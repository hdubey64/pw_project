                  large: steve 'Obs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in
                  1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near
                  bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011,
                  had built it into the world's mst valuable company. Along the
                  way he helped to transform seven industries: personal
                  computing, animated music, phones, tablet computing, retail
                  stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the
                  pantheon of America's great innovators, along with Thomas
                  Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
                  saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten,
                  history will remember how they applied Imagination to
                  technology and business.

                     One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished
                     writing most of the book, I asked him again about his
                     tendency to be rough on people. "Look at the results," he
                     replied. "These are all smart people I work with, and any
                     of them could get a top job at another place if they were
                     truly feeling brutalized. But they don't." Then he paused
                     for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, "And we got
                     some amazing things done." Indeed, he and Apple had had a
                     string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater
                     than that of any other innovative company in modern times:
                     iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook,
                     iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention every
                     Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
                     surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who
                     had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife,
                     sister, and four children.
